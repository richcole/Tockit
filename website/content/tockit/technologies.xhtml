        <h1>Technologies to be used in the Tockit project</h1>
        <p>One basic aspect is that the development should be <strong>object-oriented</strong>, <strong>component-based</strong> and <strong>iterative</strong>. The code should be the result of a software engineering process and not a simple hack, documentation is very important to us (really <tt>:-)</tt>)</p>
        <p>The main programming language of our choice is <strong>Java</strong>. This is mainly due to the fact of its broad support and its ease of use in comparision to C++. One of the main advantages is the large number of standardized libraries.</p>
        <p>The file formats should be build using <strong>XML</strong>. Again it is mainly the availabilty of tools and documentation that makes XML a technology of our choice. The interoperability of our framework with other tools should be easier with XML based files formats, esp. writing export filters will often be just a writing a simple XSL file.</p>
        <p>The framework should offer the option to use three-tier architectures like using a <strong>relational database</strong> as backend, a <strong>Java Servlet server</strong> for application control and a <strong>web browser</strong> as frontend. The database might even need a separate abstraction layer if an application needs to operate on existing databases.</p>
        <p>The details of the implementation are of course still not discussed -- this will be done in the design phase of the projects first iteration.</p>
