<h1>Status of the Tockit project</h1>

<p>Currently we are still planning the project. Since we want to support a broad range of applications, one of our main goals is to build a list with already implemented and some planned applications.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tockit">Sourceforge site</a> for details on our current tasks or join the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=21448">mailing list</a> to stay up-to-date.</p>
