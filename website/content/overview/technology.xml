<h1>Technologies to be used in the Tockit project</h1>

<p>Although we are still in the process of requirements engineering we have some basic ideas how the project should be realised. These ideas are build upon our previous experience with programming and using Conceptual Knowledge Processing, especially Formal Concept Analysis. Other aspects involve questions of accessibility and maintainability of software development technologies.</p>

<p>One basic aspect is that the development should be <strong>object-oriented</strong>, <strong>component-based</strong> and <strong>iterative</strong>. The code should be the result of a software engineering process and not a simple hack, documentation is very important to us (really <tt>:-)</tt>)</p>

<p>The programming language of our choice is <strong>Java</strong>. This is mainly due to the fact of its broad support and its ease of use in comparision to C++. One of the main advantages is the large number of standardized libraries.</p>

<p>The file formats should be build using <strong>XML</strong>. Again it is mainly the availabilty of tools and documentation that makes XML a technology of our choice. The interoperability of our framework with other tools should be easier with XML based files formats, esp. writing export filters will often be just a writing a simple XSL file.</p>

<p>The framework should offer the option to use three-tier architectures like using a <strong>relational database</strong> as backend, a <strong>Java Servlet server</strong> for application control and a <strong>web browser</strong> as frontend. The database might even need a separate abstraction layer if an application needs to operate on existing databases.</p>

<p>The details of the implementation are of course still not discussed -- this will be done in the design phase of the projects first iteration.</p>
