        <p>The idea for Docco came when we found a little program called 
        	<a href="http://www.brownsite.net/docsearch.htm">DocSearcher</a>. First we
        	planned on reusing some of this code, but then we figured that the interesting
        	bits are in libraries like <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/">Lucene</a>
        	and <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/poi/">POI</a> anyway, so we started
        	from scratch.</p>
        <p>Besides Lucene and POI we use <a href="http://www.pdfbox.org/">PDFbox</a> and 
            <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~phelps/Multivalent/">Multivalent</a> to support 
            other formats. <a href="http://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice</a> has to be acknowledge
            for not needing extra tools -- their documents are zipped XML files with a thoughtful
            structure and thus easy to parse with standard Java tools.</p>
        <p>From the user interface point of view Docco was inspired by earlier work on
			a Conceptual Email Manager developed by Richard Cole with C++/Qt on Linux.
			Details of the Conceptual Email Manager and a scientific description of
			the work is to be found in several papers on the 
			<a href="http://www.kvocentral.org">site of the KVO group</a>. A good example
			is <a href="http://www.kvocentral.com/kvopapers/jelia.pdf">Document Retrieval for 
			Email Search and Discovery using Formal Concept Analysis</a> by R.J.Cole, P.W.Eklund
			and G.Stumme (published in "Applied Artificial Intelligence", Volume 17, Number 3, 2003). 
			A commercial variant of the Conceptual Email Manager can be found as an outlook plugin 
			called <a href="http://www.mail-sleuth.com">Mail-Sleuth</a>.</p>
		<p>The work on Docco was financed by the <a href="http://www.dstc.edu.au">DSTC</a> and used
		    resources of the <a href="http://www.uq.edu.au">University of Queensland</a>.</p>
