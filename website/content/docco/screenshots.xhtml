        <h1>Docco Screenshot</h1>
        <p>This is how Docco 0.1 looks after querying for a keyword and two phrases on one of our document 
        collections:</p>
        <img src="docco01.png" width="798" height="620" alt="Screenshot of Docco"/>
        <p>Here is the same result set with a particular document selected:</p>
        <img src="docco02.png" width="798" height="620" alt="Screenshot of Docco"/>
        <p>Docco 0.2 has a slightly different look and the left menu is called "Index" now, but otherwise
        it is still the same, so we skip the screenshots for this version.</p>
