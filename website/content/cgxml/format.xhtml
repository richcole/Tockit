        <h1>The CGXML Format</h1>
<p>Disclaimer: this format is only a draft and probably never be an official format for CGs.</p>
<p>The CGXML format is defined using an XML Schema, the current version can be found at <a href="http://tockit.sf.net/cgxml/schema/cgxml20010821.xsd" target="schema">http://tockit.sf.net/cgxml/schema/cgxml20010821.xsd</a>. A short overview of the format follows, there is also <a href="schemadoc/index.html" target="doc">a more complete documentation</a>.</p>
<p>CGXML offers two starting element, one for single graphs and one for a complete knowledge base (module). We tried to model the structure as explicit as possible to allow easy access and control for the parts which results in a quite verbose but easy to handle format. The XML Schema file contains a number of annotations, a more complete rationale should follow once the format is more stable.</p>
