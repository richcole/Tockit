        <h1>CGXML Files</h1>
<p>CGXML is currently changed quite often, please understand that we don't update this page regularly. You can access the current versions of all files using the <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/tockit/cgxml/">Sourceforge CVS webfrontend</a>. The XML Schema can be found in the <tt>spec</tt> directory, examples are in the <tt>examples</tt> directory and there is also a <tt>stylesheet</tt> directory containing XSLT files.</p>
