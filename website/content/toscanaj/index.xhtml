        <h1>ToscanaJ</h1>
<p>With ToscanaJ we try to port one of the classic Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) tools into a more modern environment. The old <emph>Toscana</emph> is written in C++ and OWL and suffers from typical legacy problems. There has been some new attemps to revive the old environment, but we believe that there are better approaches to write and maintain a software like this.</p>
<p>We decided to rewrite Toscana in Java using XML instead of the proprietary text format used before. There is a running prototype, but currently the development of ToscanaJ is sleeping since all programmers are busy with other projects. Hopefully we will return soon.</p>
