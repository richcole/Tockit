        <h1>ToscanaJ</h1>
<p>With ToscanaJ we try to port one of the classic Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) tools into a more modern environment. The old <emph>Toscana</emph> is written in C++ and OWL and suffers from typical legacy problems. There has been some new attemps to revive the old environment, but we believe that there are better approaches to write and maintain a software like this.</p>
<p>We decided to rewrite Toscana in Java using XML instead of the proprietary text format used before. There are already some working releases offering the most important features of the old programs and some new ones like SVG export or a highlighting function for nested line diagrams.</p>
<p>The development of ToscanaJ has been forked into a separate project with its <a href="http://toscanaj.sourceforge.net">own website</a>. The developers of ToscanaJ are mostly members of the Tockit project and the two projects will share some code, the separate project was created mainly to emphasize the special role Toscana has in Formal Concept Analysis.</p>
