These were the sources for Toscana/J the Java version of Toscana.

They were created between March, 28 and March, 30 in the year 2001 on 
the Toscana/J hackfest of the KVO group (http://www.int.gu.edu.au/kvo).

The program has moved on into a separate project on Sourceforge, take
a look at http://toscanaj.sourceforge.net. This repository still contains
old versions of ToscanaJ but is not actively used anymore.
