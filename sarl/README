               Sarl - Sets and Relations Library

1.0 Introduction.

The purpose of this library is to provide a low level interface to the
manipulation of sets and binary relations of integers. Although not
currently designed within the interface there is the hope that triadic
relations will also be supported.

2.0 Requirements

The current version of sarl has been compiled with:
  * swig 1.3.16
  * gcc version 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.3 2.96-110)
  * jdk 1.3.1_03
  * python 1.5.2 or python2.2

3.0 Resources

The Sarl Wiki (kvo.itee.uq.edu.au) is a place where you can find
up to date information about how to compile and install Sarl.

3.0 Compilation and Testing

Currently the only distribution method for Sarl is from CVS.

3.1 Building from CVS

The construct a ./configure file 

  aclocal -I.
  automake 
  autoconf

Then to the configuration script

 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/test; 

Then to build and check the software

  make check

Then to install the libraries

  make install

Since the change to autoconf the java and python builds are
incomplete. An help anyone can provide here would be much appreciated.

4.0 Documentation and Links

Currently there is no documentation for sarl. A wiki for the Tockit
project will hopefully be constructed within a week and most design
discussion will take place there as well as the production of
tutorials and interface documentation.
