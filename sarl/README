               Sarl - Sets and Relations Library

1.0 Introduction.

The purpose of this library is to provide a low level interface to the
manipulation of sets and binary relations of integers. Although not
currently designed within the interface there is the hope that triadic
relations will also be supported.

2.0 Compilation and Testing

Currently only linux is supported, although we intend to also support
MacOS and Win32. The current implementation requires a C++ compiler
and the standard template library.

  To compile the shared library:

    > make

  To compile and run the C interface tests:

    > make test

  To run the python interface test

    > make
    > cd python
    > python py_sarl.py

3.0 Documentation and Links

Currently there is no documentation for sarl. A wiki for the Tockit
project will hopefully be constructed within a week and most design
discussion will take place there as well as the production of
tutorials and interface documentation.
