Contains all interfaces and classes needed to create and use a plugin. 


<h2>Package Description</h2>
<p>
This package contains:
<ul> 
	<li>
	Plugin interface. We expect all plugins to implement this interface.
	</li>
	<li>
	PluginClassLoader - class loader capable of loading plugins.
	</li>
	<li>
	PluginLoader - responsible for scanning plugins directory for plugins and 
	loading all found plugins.
	</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Related Information</h2>
<h4>Plugin Development directory structure</h4>
<p>
A plugin should have following directory structure:
<ul>
	<li> 
	source directory - containing source files.
	</li>
	<li>
	libs directory - containing all needed libs.
	</li>
	<li>
	plugin.txt file - optional. @see PluginLoader for more details. 
	</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h4>What distribution should look like.</h4>
<p>
We expect a plugin directory containing:
<ul>
	<li>libs</li>
	<li>plugin.jar</li>
	<li>plugin.txt - optional
</ul>
</p>

<h4>How to write a plugin</h4>
<p>
How to write a plugin:
<ul>
	<li>Create a plugin dir structure as described above</li>
	<li>Implement Plugin interface as described above</li>
	<li>Figure out distribution mechanism (probably using our ant script),
		create distribution directory in the form described above. </li>
	<li>Copy plugin directory into plugins dir in the program distribution. </li>
</ul>
</p>


<h4>Ant build files</h4>
<p>
For examples see docco plugins directory which contains build.xml and buildPlugin.xml scripts.
</p>
<p>
Script build.xml should be called to compile and build a distribution of all
plugins found in this dir. (Assuming each subdirectory is containing 
a plugin).
</p>
<p>
buildPlugin.xml can be called from build.xml to compile and build 
distribution of an individual plugin. This script can be also used 
standalone - in this case we recommend to copy it into your plugin 
directory and change properties corresponding to your plugin specifics.
