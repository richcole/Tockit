<title>Tockit: Extended Preferences and GUI</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>At the moment this package containts only the ExtendedPreferences class, which
adds some features for further session management to the java.util.prefs.Preferences
class. Not all of that code is Swing-specific, but it is made to be used for Swing
programs to manage their sessions.</p>
<p>It is planned to add some GUI for preference management into this package later on.</p>
