<title>Tockit: Relational Algebra Package</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Relational Algebra</h1>
<p>This package implements a model and operations for relational algebra. The
main notion is the one of relations which are sets of tuples and which can contain
names for the dimensions. The latter means that it is a bit of a mixture of the
named and unnamed perspective. The idea is to use the unnamed perspective for all
calculations while allowing to attach names for application-specific purposes.</p>

<p>All objects put into the model are assumed to be values in the sense of:</p>
<ul>
<li>their identity is based on Object.equals(Object)</li>
<li>they don't change</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these two features is broken, the results of the library code are
undefined. More specifically: if the notion of identity is not fulfilled, you
might find duplicates where there shouldn't be any and if the values get changed
after adding them to tuples and relations they might not be retrieved properly,
most likely you will get misses on containment checks.</p>

<p>This package contains two subpackages: org.tockit.relations.model models the
data structures while org.tockit.relations.operations models the operations of the
algebra.</p>
