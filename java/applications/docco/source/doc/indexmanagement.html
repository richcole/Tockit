<h1>Creating and Managing Indexes</h1>

<p>The index stores all the information about your documents which is used during
the queries. When you query for certain documents, the program does not search
the file systems for the results, it uses only the index. This is why it is so
fast in finding results, but it also means that you have to manage the index
a bit.</p>

<p>Although the program could run on multiple indexes (a.k.a. indices), the current
version supports only using one at a time. Updating an index is not yet supported
either -- if you want to run on a newer index you have to create a new one. This
might change soon, but we don't promise anything.</p>

<p>The two things you can do with the index are:</p>

<ul>
<li>replace it with a new one by calling File->Create New Index...</li>
<li>add more files into it by calling File->Add Files Into Index...</li>
</ul>

<p>If you add files into an index, the program will ask you to specify which files
to add. In the file dialog you can pick files and directories. If you chose a directory,
all its contents will be indexed. It is also allowed to pick multiple files and
directories at once.</p>

<p>Once you have selected files to index and hit the "Index" button, the program
will start indexing in the background. The indexer will tell you about the progress
in the status bar at the bottom of the window. You can add more files/directory
into this process while the program is still working. You can also start querying,
but the results will be incomplete if the program hasn't finished the indexing
yet. You can see that it is finished when the status bar shows "Ready!" again.</p>

<p>Avoid closing the program while the indexer is still running. This will result
in an incomplete index, which will work without problems, but the program will not
remember that it still has to index some documents. This way you will not be able
to find all documents without redoing the whole process.</p>

<p>In the current version Docco indexes files with the extensions: TXT, HTM/HTML,
DOC, XLS and PDF. Support for PDF and the MS Office formats is still a bit flaky,
documents might get ignored due to that.</p>
