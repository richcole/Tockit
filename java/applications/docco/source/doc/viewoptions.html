<h2>Phantom Nodes</h2>

Sometimes you will find that your data has implications of the form "every
document containg the keywords A and B also contains C". For example in some
document collection all documents containing "program" and "source" also contain
"code". If you query for all three keywords, you will find that Docco displays
the node showing the combination of "program" and "source" but nothing else as a 
smaller node. This combination does not really exist and therefore the node is not
needed structurally, it is just added as layout addition to make the diagram more
structured. You can turn these nodes off, which gives smaller diagrams at the
expense of less structure. This is usually helpful if your query returns many
phantom nodes.

<h2>Showing Matches Only Once</h2>

Documents that match "a" and "b" also match just "a". Therefore they will appear
at least at two nodes: the one for "a" and the one for ("a" and "b"). You can
reduce the display by only showing the documents which match only the queries for
a node but nothing else. In the example the documents matching "a" and "b" would
not be shown at the "a" node, since this node would show only the documents matching
"a" but nothing else. This option can be changed in the user interface and affects
the diagram and the contents of the tree view.
