Changes since Docco 0.4:

Docco:
- Update to Lucene 2.0.0 (no code changes needed)
- Bugfix: the OpenOffice handler could miss content before, which should be
  fixed now
- Support for ODF (OpenDocumentFormat as used e.g. by OpenOffice 2.x) has
  been added
- The default index directory is now in the user's home directory instead
  of using the working directory
  
  

Changes from Docco 0.3 to 0.4:

Docco:
- symlinks are not followed anymore (Linux/UNIX)
- index locks are detected and can be removed by the user
- extra information for index (contents, mappings) is stored after the index
  was created, not only on shutdown. This means Docco can access the index
  even after an unclean exit (it will be locked, though)
- support for the RTF format (some of it)
- nested diagrams can be created using a new button
- Lucene is updated to version 1.9.1, all code has been updated to not have
  any deprecation warnings
- analyzers are now supported, which most importantly means we support stop-
  words and stemming for a number of languages, with the choice of analyzer
  being attached to each index -- thus Docco can query different directories
  with different language tools

POI-Plugin:
- support for PowerPoint files
- fixed a bug leaking open input streams
- updated to POI version 2.5.1final

PDFbox-Plugin:
- updated to PDFbox version 0.7.2
