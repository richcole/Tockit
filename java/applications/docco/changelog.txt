==============================
Changes since Docco 0.5:
==============================
Docco:
- updated Lucene to 2.4.0 (no code changes)
- updated BrowserLauncher to 1.3 (no code changes)

POI-Plugin:
- updated POI library from version 2.5.1final to 3.2final
- switched text extraction to new extractor classes offered by POI, which
  results in better extraction (e.g. more PowerPoint files have their text
  extracted)

Multivalent-Plugin:
- the default file mapping does not match PDF files anymore, since the error
  rate was too high and Multivalent might get PDF files instead of PDFbox.
  It is still possible to use Multivalent for PDF by adding the file mapping
  manually.
  
==============================
Changes from Docco 0.4 to 0.5:
==============================

Docco:
- Docco is now internationalized, i.e. it can be easily adjusted to local
  languages and customs. Translations into German and Dutch are part of the 
  distribution.
- update to Lucene 2.1.0 (no code changes needed)
- Bugfix: the OpenOffice handler could miss content before, which should be
  fixed now
- support for ODF (OpenDocumentFormat as used e.g. by OpenOffice 2.x) has
  been added
- the default index directory is now in the user's home directory instead
  of using the working directory
- a new command line option "indexDirectory" can be used to set a different
  directory for the index (for this session)
- Bugfix: the path to an index is now stored properly in the index proper-
  ties file (needed for index updates)
- the information if an index is active for search or not is now kept bet-
  ween program sessions
- moving nodes in a diagram should be more natural now
- the code to open a document has been updated to a new version, which
  fixes issues on various platforms
- a new command line option "updateIndexes" can be used to let Docco update
  all indexes without running the GUI

PDFbox-Plugin:
- updated to PDFbox version 0.7.3
  

==============================
Changes from Docco 0.3 to 0.4:
==============================

Docco:
- symlinks are not followed anymore (Linux/UNIX)
- index locks are detected and can be removed by the user
- extra information for index (contents, mappings) is stored after the index
  was created, not only on shutdown. This means Docco can access the index
  even after an unclean exit (it will be locked, though)
- support for the RTF format (some of it)
- nested diagrams can be created using a new button
- Lucene is updated to version 1.9.1, all code has been updated to not have
  any deprecation warnings
- analyzers are now supported, which most importantly means we support stop-
  words and stemming for a number of languages, with the choice of analyzer
  being attached to each index -- thus Docco can query different directories
  with different language tools

POI-Plugin:
- support for PowerPoint files
- fixed a bug leaking open input streams
- updated to POI version 2.5.1final

PDFbox-Plugin:
- updated to PDFbox version 0.7.2
