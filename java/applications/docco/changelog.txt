Changes since Docco 0.3:

Docco:
- symlinks are not followed anymore (Linux/UNIX).
- index locks are detected and can be removed by the user.
- extra information for index (contents, mappings) is stored after the index
  was created, not only on shutdown. This means Docco can access the index
  even after an unclean exit (it will be locked, though).
- support for the RTF format (some of it)
- nested diagrams can be created using a new button (still buggy)

POI-Plugin:
- support for PowerPoint files
- fixed a bug leaking open input streams
