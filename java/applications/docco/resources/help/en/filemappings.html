<h1>File Mappings</h1>
<p>MS Windows based systems use the extensions of the files to identify the file
type. This is not always perfect and one of the problems is that different
extensions can actually be of the same (or at least similar) type. An example
are .log files, which are text. Or many XML formats do not use .xml as their
extension.</p>
<p>To handle this problem, Docco offers you to define your own mappings between
file extensions or naming patterns to the indexing tools that should be used on
these. You can define the mappings either when creating a new index, or you can
change the mappings on an existing index. The latter is rather useful if you notice
the original mappings did not match certain files, even though the indexing
tools could have handled it. Or you installed a new plugin to handle more file
types and you want to extend an existing index.</p>
<p>To define a mapping, you have to specify how to identify the files and which
indexing tool to use. If multiple mappings match, they will be processed in order
until an indexing tools succeeds. In the dialog to add a mapping you can chose
the indexing tool to use at the bottom, above that you can chose how to identify
the files by chosing a file filter type and give it an expression to match.</p>
<p>There are three filter types available by default:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Match extensions:</dt>
<dd>This is the most common option which just looks if a file has an extension
matching the set given. Multiple entries are separated by semicolons, e.g.
"txt;log;conf" would match all files that have one of the three extensions
"txt", "log" or "conf".</dd>
<dt>Match name with regular expression:</dt>
<dd>The expression given is tried as a regular expression against the name of
the file (including extension, but excluding the directory names). This way
you can match files whose name follows certain structures, e.g. ".*_log" would
match the files "my_log", "program_log", etc.</dd>
<dt>Match path with regular expression:</dt>
<dd>This is very similar to the one before, just that in this case the expression
is matched against the whole path. This includes all names of the directories
above the file, the file name itself and the file extension.</dd>
