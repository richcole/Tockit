<h1>Diagram Options</h1>

<p>This page described the options found in the Diagram menu.</p>

<h2>Settings for the Diagram</h2>

<h3>Show all possible combinations</h3>

<p>
Sometimes you will find that your data has implications of the form "every
document containg the keywords A and B also contains C". For example in some
document collection all documents containing "program" and "source" also contain
"code". If you query for all three keywords, you will find that Docco displays
the node showing the combination of "program" and "source" but nothing else as a 
smaller node. This combination does not really exist and therefore the node is not
needed structurally, it is just added as layout addition to make the diagram more
structured. You can turn these nodes off, which gives smaller diagrams at the
expense of less structure. This is usually helpful if your query returns many
small nodes.
</p>

<h3>Show matches only once</h3>

<p>
Documents that match "a" and "b" also match just "a". Therefore they will appear
at least at two nodes: the one for "a" and the one for ("a" and "b"). You can
reduce the display by only showing the documents which match only the queries for
a node but nothing else. In the example the documents matching "a" and "b" would
not be shown at the "a" node, since this node would show only the documents matching
"a" but nothing else. This option can be changed in the user interface and affects
the diagram and the contents of the tree view.
</p>

<h2>Graphic Export</h2>

<p>You can export the diagram shown in Docco as a graphic. By default Docco
supports exporting PNG and JPEG graphics. Whenever a diagram is shown, you can
call Diagram->Export Diagram... from the menu which will show you a dialog in
which you can select the file to write to, the file format, the export size and
some other options. The easiest way to use this is just to enter the name of the
output file while leaving the file type selector on "All Files". In this case
Docco will chose the format you want by looking at the extension you give the
file, e.g. if you save the file as "search result.png", the file saved will be
a PNG. Alternatively you can pick the format you want in which case Docco will
add an appropriate extension if you don't provide one yourself.</p>

<p>By adding <a href="plugins.html">Plugins</a> into Docco you can extend the
number of graphic formats supported. After you added a graphic export plugin,
the list of file types will offer the new options.</p>

<h2>Printing</h2>

<p>Any diagram shown can be printed in the usual manner, using the Diagram->Print...
and Diagram->Print Setup... menu entries. Again the default settings should be
ok in most situtations, you should be able to just use the print function without
having to set up anything.</p>

<p>Printing in Docco always prints the diagram as large as possible on the
printer and paper chosen. If you want smaller printouts, you have to use the
graphic export capabilities.</p>
