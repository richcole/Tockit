<h1>Querying</h1>

<p>The most simple type of query you can do is to ask the program about a number
of keywords. Keywords can be any word in a document, except for the so-called
"stopwords". Stopwords are words that occur too often and are thus not interesting
to index -- they would just increase the size of the database. Typical stopwords
are "the", "and", "or" and similar words.</p>

<p>If you ask for a set of keywords the program will find all documents matching
either of them. It will then show you the different results and how they combine.
In the diagram created the documents matching anyone keyword will be at the top
node, the layer below are documents matching a certain keyword, below that all
possible combinations are displayed. Nodes that are smaller (so-called "phantom
nodes") are combinations which don't exist. This happens if you have implications,
i.e. if you looked for documents containing "Java", "Brazil" and "coffee" you might
find that all documents containing the first two keywords also contain "coffee".
In this case the node representing the combination of "Java" and "Brazil" (but
nothing else) will be a phantom node -- this particular combination does not
exist without getting something else.</p>

<h2>Extended Query Syntax</h2>

<p>There are some other things you can ask about. First of all you can ask for
phrases. Phrases are anything which you put into double quotes and they are
searched as a whole. So if you ask for "Formal Concept Analysis" written in
double quotes you will find only documents containing these three words in the
given order.</p>

<p>Wildcards can be used to search for keywords with a certain prefix or unknown
spelling. You can search for "pres*" would match "president", "prestige" and other 
words. The asterisk can be used at the end of a word as well in the middle. It is
not allowed to use it as the first symbol, though. The same applies for the second
wildcard character, the question mark. While the asterisk represents any number
of letters, the question mark represents exactly one.</p>

<p>Parentheses can be used to group results. If you put some keywords or phrases
into parentheses, they will get a combined node, representing the documents
containing either of the keywords. To use parentheses you have to give at least
one other keyword, if you put the whole query into parentheses nothing will
change.</p>

<p>A minus sign in front of a keyword or other query expression negates the query
part. This means you ask for all documents <emph>not</emph> containing this
keyword or matching the query part. To use negation you have to give at least
one positive query part.</p>

<p>Within parentheses the negation can be used. You can also force the occurance
of certain keywords by using a plus symbol. For example "+java +view -coffee" asks
for any document containing both "java" and "view" but not "coffee".</p>

<p>You can actually use most of the syntax supported by Lucene, but these are the
most important ones and some of the rest is beyond the scope of this little
introduction. See http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/queryparsersyntax.html
for more detail.</p>

<h2>Querying other fields</h2>

<p>Beneath all the different ways you can use to search for things in the text
of a document, you can also query something about certain other aspects of them.
This is done by using a prefix, separated by a colon. An example would be asking
for "author:smith" which finds all documents having someone called "Smith" as
author. Of course this assumes that this information was stored in the first place.
Author information is extracted from HTML, PDF and MS Office documents if it
was set by the author.</p>

<p>Here is a list with the prefixes and what they do -- note that many of them
rely on certain information stored in the documents and that the program does
not yet support range searches for date or size information:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Prefix</th><th>Meaning</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>title</td><td>The document title</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>author</td><td>The author of a document</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>keywords</td><td>Keywords given as meta-information in a document</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>mod_date</td><td>The last time the document was changed in the file system</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>creation_date</td><td>The time the document was created (if stored in the document)</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>ext</td><td>The file extension, e.g. "html"</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>path</td><td>The path to the document</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>name</td><td>The file name of the document</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>path_words</td><td>The path, separated into words</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>size</td><td>The size of the file</td>
</tr>
</table>
