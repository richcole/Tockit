This folder contains some of the sources for the libraries used in Docco.
They should be in the same version as the libraries in the directory above
and they are set up in a way that they can used directly in Eclipse, i.e.
they are zipped so the toplevel package is the root directory of the ZIP
file.

Note that this implies that these files are not necessary the original
source downloads, but quite often repackaged.
