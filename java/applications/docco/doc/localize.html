Localizing Docco
</font>
</h1>

<p>
Docco can be localized to match the expectations of users of a particular background. Some part
of that is done automatically such as adjusting the format for dates and time. Which localization
is used is determined through the Java configuration, which in turn uses the setting of the
underlying operating system. The locale is determined by (a) the 2-letter language code as
defined by <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php">ISO 639-1</a> and
(b) the two-letter country code as defined in <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/02iso-3166-code-lists/list-en1.html">ISO 3166</a>.
</p>

<p>
Translation into the local language is done through so-called ressource bundles: text files 
containing pairs of keys used by the program to identify the text and the translation to be used
when running. These translation files can be found in the "resources" folder and have the
name pattern:
</p>
<pre>
  [programPart]Messages(_[language code](_[country code])).properties
</pre>
<p>
In this pattern <code>[programPart]</code> refers to the part of the program being translated,
most important is the "gui" part. The language and country code parts are optional, the program
will automatically pick the most specific translation available. If no translation for a particular
country is available the generic language one is chosen (e.g. "_fr" for generic French if the
locale is Canadian French but no "_fr_CA" is available). If no translation for a particular
language is available, the default translation (no language, no country code) is chosen, which
should be US English.
</p>

<p>
To translate Docco into a new language, pick the default resource bundle for the part you want
to translate (usually <code>guiMessages.properties</code>), and copy the file so that the file
name matches the locale you target. If you translate for a particular country use both language
and country code, if you translate into a generic language just use the language code. As a rule
of thumb you might want to translate into a generic language file if there is no such file yet;
e.g. if you want to do Canadian French, but there is no French translation at all, call your file
<code>guiMessages_fr.properties</code>; if there is a French translation already, call it
<code>guiMessages_fr_CA.properties</code>.
</p>

<p>
Translation should be done using a specialized
tool such as the <a href="https://prbeditor.dev.java.net/">Property Resource Bundle Editor</a>.
Such a tool not only ensures the file format does not get broken, it also helps when updating
a translation to a newer version of the program. In theory you can use any text editor but note
that you have to escape any non-standard character to ensure platform compatibility. Tools like
the PRB Editor do that for you.
</p>

<p>
Some of the translated strings will contain numbers in curly braces which indicate that the
program will fill in further information in this position. For example a string in the English
translation could look like this:
<pre>
  {0} out of {1} files processed.
</pre>
In such a case every translation has to contain the same references, although the order can
change, e.g. a different translation into English could look like this:
<pre>
  {1} files, {0} processed.
</pre>
As long as the same information is conveyed any translation is valid.
</p>

<p>
The references can be to numbers but they can also be to file names, dates and other bits
of information. Changing the actual value references is not possible within the translation
process but requires a program change. If that should be required for some reason a change
request should be filed with the developers.
</p>

<p>
The translation file for the GUI messages also contains the references used to enter the help.
The online help consists of HTML pages stored in a language-specific subfolder of the resources
folder, e.g. <code>resources/help/en</code> for the US-English help. To translate the help system
adjust the translation for the location of the starting files (<code>index.html</code> 
and <code>about.html</code>) to point to your translated versions.
</p>

<p>
Assuming you are running with your target locale set, the new file will be picked up automatically
on each start. Just change the existing translations one by one and restart the application to see
the result.
</p>

<p>
If the localization used by Docco is not the one wanted, a different one can be used by setting
a Java property in the command line call for Docco. This is documented in the JVM description,
e.g. enforcing US English localization could look like this:
</p>
<pre>
  java -Duser.language=en -Duser.country=US -jar Docco.jar
</pre>
