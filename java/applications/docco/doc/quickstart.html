<h1>Quick Start</h1>

<p>The first thing that happens if you start the program for the first time should 
be the appearance of a file open dialog that lets you pick files and directories. 
Pick any, click the "Index" button and wait. This might take quite a while,
depending on many factors, most noticably the number of files involved. You might
want to try with a smaller structure first before you run it on your companies
main network drive.</p>

<p>At the moment we index the following document types:</p>
<ul>
<li>plain text (*.txt and some programming language extensions)</li>
<li>HTML documents (*.html/*.htm/*.xhtml)</li>
<li>XML documents (*.xml)</li>
<li>OpenOffice documents (*.sx*)</li>
<li>PDF documents (*.pdf, requires plugin)</li>
<li>Word and Excel documents (*.doc/*.xls, requires plugin)</li>
</ul>
<p>Support for the latter two is still work in progress, some documents get ignored.</p>

<p>Querying is as easy as entering a number of words you might want to find in your
documents. Three or four is a good size to start with. Note that you can do this while 
the program is still creating the index, but
then you might get smaller result sets than expected. The program is finished with
the indexing once it says "Ready!" in the status bar at the bottom of the main window.</p>

<p>The diagram you get as query result shows you how the words you asked for combine
in the documents. Each node represents a possible combination of the words and the number
underneath shows you the number of documents found. If you leave the mouse on a node for
a moment you get a flyout that shows you the keywords at that node. If you click on a node
all documents will be displayed on the right hand side in a tree view. Once you found the
document you are looking for in there, you can just double-click it to open it.</p>
