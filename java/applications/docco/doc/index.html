<h1>Docco Overview</h1>
<p>Docco is a tool that should help you finding documents in your document collection.
It first scans all documents for the appearance of words (called "indexing") and
then lets you search for those keywords and some other information like the author
of certain documents (called "querying"). After a query the results are displayed
first in a diagram showing you all possible combinations. Once you select a certain
node in this diagram, you will get a tree structure similar to the one used in
standard tools like file dialogs or the Windows file explorer. From there you
can open the documents in their default application by double-clicking or get
more information in the summary pane at the bottom.</p>
