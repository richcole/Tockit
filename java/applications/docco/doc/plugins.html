<h1>Plugins</h1>
<p>Docco's functionality can be extended by plugins. Plugins are little program
components which are installed into the "plugin" directory in the Docco 
installation. To install a plugin you have to extract it and copy the extracted
folder into this directory. After restarting Docco you should be able to use
the new functionality.</p>

<p>Docco plugins can be downloaded from the Tockit project's download pages,
where you find the latest Docco version, too. At the time of writing the following
plugins exist:</p>
