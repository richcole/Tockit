<h1>Creating and Managing Indexes</h1>

<p>An index stores all the information about your documents which is used during
the queries. When you query for certain documents, the program does not search
the file systems for the results, it uses only the index. This is why it is so
fast in finding results, but it also means that you have to manage the index
a bit.</p>

<p>The program can run on multiple indexes (a.k.a. indices). This is useful if
you want to index different directories which are unrelated. You can also use
it to search only on some of your files, ignoring others, since each index can
be deactivated for a search.</p>

<h2>Creating a new Index</h2>

<p>To create a new Index call Indexing->Index directory... from the menu bar.
A dialog will be opened, asking you to chose a directory to index and a name
for the Index to use within the program. Below that you can chose how Docco
should treat the words in documents by giving an analyzer for the documents.
The role of the analyzer is to chose the stopwords (which words to ignore),
to decide how to seperate words and to change words into simpler forms e.g.
by ignoring capitalization or the endings of the words. This has to be done
depending on the language of the documents, so you should try to pick the
right analyzer for your collection.</p>

<p>You can also change the file mappings
using the button to the right, which is discussed on the 
<a href="filemappings.html">File Mappings</a> page. In most situations the default
settings for the mappings should be the most useful ones.</p>

<p>Once you have selected a directory to index and hit the "Index" button, the program
will start indexing in the background. The indexer will tell you about the progress
in the status bar at the bottom of the window. You can index more directories by
repeating the steps before, even while the first process is still running. You 
can also start querying,
but the results will be incomplete if the program hasn't finished the indexing
yet. You can see that it is finished when the status bar shows "Ready!" again.</p>

<p>Avoid closing the program while the indexer is still running. This will result
in an incomplete index, which will work without problems, but the program will not
remember that it still has to index some documents. You will have to update the
index manually (see below) to finish the indexing process.</p>

<h2>Options for existing Indexes</h2>

<p>Once you have created an Index, it will appear in the Indexing menu under the
name given in the dialog. With each index you have the following options:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Active</dt>
<dd>This toggle decides if an index is searched or not. Whenever you submit a
search, it is matched against all active indexes, while the ones not set active
are ignored.</dd>
<dt>Update Index</dt>
<dd>Updates the index with respect to the current files. New files get added, 
deleted files get removed from the index, changed files get re-indexed. This
happens in the background in the same fashion a new index is created. You can
keep using Docco for queries at the same time.</dd>
<dt>Edit File Mappings...</dt>
<dd>You can change the settings which files are indexed in hindsight and then
run an update on the index. This is especially useful if you notice that some
files were missed due to the wrong settings.</dd>
<dt>Delete Index</dt>
<dd>Deletes the index from Docco and the underlying file system. If you create
an index and delete it later, the original state is restored, there will be no
traces in your file system.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The indexing menu also allows you to update all indexes at once. If you use
Docco for a file system that changes quite often, you should run this option
regularly. It will use some of your computers resources, but as long as not too
many files were added or changed a modern system should be able to handle this
easily. See also the options for setting the indexing priority below.</p>

<h2>Indexing priority</h2>

<p>Docco allows you to set a different priority for its indexing process. The
priority tells the computer how much of its resources should go into the indexing
process. If the priority is high, the indexing will be fast, but your computer
might get very slow doing other things (on some operating systems programs
might even appear to be broken if you use the highest setting). If you put the
priority on a low setting, the indexing process is not as fast, but you will not
notice that it is running.</p>

<p>The normal setting used by default is a good compromise. If you want to leave
your computer to create a large index unattended you might want to go for higher
priorities to speed up this process. For updates in the background the normal
setting is often ok (depending on the capabilties of your computer), but it might
also be a good idea to lower the priority.</p>
