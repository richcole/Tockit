Docco Readme File
========================

Welcome to Docco, a little indexing program build on top of the Lucene search
engine from the Apache Foundation (http://www.apache.org). It indexes the
documents of a folder in your file system recursively and then lets you
query the contents. The results are displayed in a structured form using a
technique called Formal Concept Analysis.

This is still a very early release, but it should work. A quick start manual
can be found in the help menu and in the documentation subfolder. You find the 
licence for the program in the main folder and the licences for the libraries 
used in the folder named "libs". To run it you need a Java JRE/JDK of version
1.4 or higher, then just run the start script for your platform.

Enjoy the program and feel free to send feedback to tockit-general@lists.sf.net.
